This file contains the dataset and the Python codes that I used for my Honors Thesis. Please click on "Honors Thesis Dataset 2.0.xlsx". After you click on the file name, please click the "get raw" button to download the file. Afterwards, execute these Python files sequentially to replicate my Honors Thesis models and calculations. I crafted the Excel tables manually from the results of these code files, which is why they are not uploaded here.
